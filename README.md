###### Description:
My project is an online shopping website. In fact, I put computer and related products in it. My website has 5 sections. 
These sections include the following sections: laptops, software, hardware, computers, products.
In this website, there is a section called the most popular content, which you can access new content that users like by referring to this section.
In the file I sent, there is a folder called Computer. Inside this file you will also find folders with the following names: css, fonts, image, image, computer1 in html format.
In the css section you can see the codes related to the appearance features of the site. These appearance features include colors, content placement, and more.
There is also a responsive section in this file, which includes settings for the position of the letters on the site.
In the Fonts folder you can see the fonts used by that site. If you do not understand it, your knowledge of computer language is low.
In the first image file, you will see the photos that have been uploaded to the site for the products.
In the Photos folder, you will see photos related to the bookmarks section. Bookmarks refer to scrolling photos, Twitter, YouTube, etc.
There is a section called 'Computer' in the computer folder which is in html format and you can run the site virtually and server.
In the fonts file, you will see folders that have been organized using these site commands.
The next file that I want to introduce to you is the folder related to the hard drive purchase section.
Inside the hard drive file, we see several sections with the following names: 'css', 'fonts', 'image', 'images', 'hard1.html'
In one of these files called 'css' we see two parts of the relevant code: the hard partition code and the responsive partition code.
One of the files, called 'fonts', contains the relevant code for the fonts, which is for the hard drive.
These codes are responsible for setting the sections related to the visual beauty of this section.
You can also view these codes virtually by clicking on one of these files.
In the photo file, you can see photos related to different sections of the site.
One of the files is called laptop. In this file, you will see photos related to laptop products, and you will also see the fonts section, which is responsible for the settings and codes of this section. In fact, without these codes, this website would never exist.
You can enter the code written from the laptop section by clicking on the css file. You can also find the code related to the responsive section in this file.
The next file I want to introduce is the product section file. Also inside this file you will see css related codes, fonts, photos, photos and products 1 again in html format.
The next file is the software section, which has an html file as well as fonts, photos, photos and css.
This is my description for my final project.
